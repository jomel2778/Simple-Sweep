# Simple-Sweep Pro
Fullstack  Project

# Overview
An ARP sweep and port scan in one. Completed through a series of prompts.
With this Python script you can easily sweep a network and find hosts.  SimpleSweepPro then takes the results and completes a port scan.  Nice, neat and simple.

# Details
Open to enter IP(s) as a command line argument. 
An ARP scan is automatically performed on IP(s) entered and then prompted with the option to try and ping the IP(s) found during the ARP scan. 
If no IP is provided it will automatically perform an ARP scan on the network asking users for ports to be scanned then prompt users if they would also like to perform a
ping on the IPs found during ARP scan.
