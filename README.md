# Simple-Sweep Pro
Open to inter IP(s) as a command line argument. ARP scan is automatically performed on IP(s) entered and then automatically try to ping the IP(s) found during the ARP scan.  If no IP is provided will automatically perform an ARP scan on the network asking users for ports to be scanned then prompt users if they would also like to perform a ping on the IPs found during ARP scan.
